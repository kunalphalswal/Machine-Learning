# Machine-Learning
Learning basics of machine learning.

Projects in progress:
1. Sentiment Analyzer trained on IMDB dataset and uses transformer architecture.
2. Text Generation Model trained on enwik8 dataset, using transformer architecture.

Enwik8 text file:
1. Download the text file from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nightfury1103/enwik8).
2. Extract it.
3. Remove unusual line terminators (I did after opening it on VS code) to make it compatible for reading.
